# 2D-Shape-3D-Shape-Calculater

Hi, I'm Ali, and welcome to my site
this code is a 2D and 3D shape calculator using C++. It was a university project, and I wrote the Instructor's question.

Write a program calculating the perimeter, surface area, and volume for the following 2D/3D shapes. The program has to ask the user to choose a 2D or 3D calculator:
1.	2D Calculator
2.	3D Calculator

If the user chooses 1, they will get the following list of 2D shapes to choose from, then calculate the [perimeter and area]:
1.	Square.
2.	Rectangle.
3.	Circle.
4.	Triangle.
5.	Ellipse

If the user chooses 2, they will get the following list of 3D shapes (solid) to choose from, then calculate the [surface area and volume]
1.	Cube.
2.	Cuboid.
3.	Sphere.
4.	Cylinder.
5.	Cone.
